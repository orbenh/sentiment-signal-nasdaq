# Sentiment Signal: Financial Newsâ€“Driven NASDAQ Forecast

This project explores how financial news sentiment aligns with movements in the NASDAQ index. By analyzing headlines from **CNBC**, **Reuters**, and **The Guardian**, we assess whether shifts in language can anticipate market trends.

To complete this analysis, we:
- Collected and cleaned news headlines
- Used **GPT-2** to generate missing descriptions
- Applied **BERT-based sentiment models** from Hugging Face to assign sentiment scores (on a 2â€“10 scale)
- Aggregated sentiment monthly and compared with average NASDAQ values

We then trained two forecasting models:
-  A simple **linear regression**
-  A **SARIMAX** time series model (including sentiment as an external regressor)

##  NLP and LLM Models Used

-  **GPT-2** (via Hugging Face) â€” to generate summaries for headlines missing descriptions
-  **BERT (Sentiment Analysis variant)** â€” to score sentiment on combined headline + summary pairs

These models were applied using the Hugging Face `transformers` pipeline.

##  Technologies

- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Hugging Face Transformers (GPT-2, BERT)
- `statsmodels` for SARIMAX
- `ruptures` for structural break detection
- `yfinance` for stock data
