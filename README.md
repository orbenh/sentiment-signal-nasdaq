## Sentiment Signal: Financial News–Driven NASDAQ Forecast

This project investigates how shifts in financial news sentiment sourced from CNBC, Reuters, and The Guardian align with movements in the NASDAQ index. Using NLP tools, GPT-2–based augmentation, and time-series analysis, we demonstrate how media tone can both reflect and forecast market behavior.

##  Objectives

- Analyze sentiment in ~143K financial headlines (2017–2020)
- Augment missing descriptions using GPT-2 generation
- Score headline sentiment using a BERT-based model
- Aggregate sentiment monthly per source and overall
- Merge sentiment trends with NASDAQ index data
- Detect structural breaks in news tone and price
- Build a regression model to forecast market trends

---

##  Highlights

- Detected structural breaks during:
  - US–China Trade War (late 2019)
  - COVID-19 market crash (early 2020)
- GPT-2 augmentation preserved tone but introduced mild noise
- Non-synthetic sentiment had **stronger correlation** with NASDAQ  
  _(Pearson r ≈ –0.31)_
- Simple linear regression predicted NASDAQ movements  
  3 months ahead with bootstrapped confidence intervals
